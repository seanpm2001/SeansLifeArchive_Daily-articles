# Environmental warning

My journal shall remain digital, and nothing more (unless a new technology comes along that replaces digital) that being said, do not mass-print the journal. Due to the size of the journal, this would kill an entire large forest for every ~100 to ~100,000 copies made.

## Stick with the eBook version

I do not want my journal to ever be printed in full on paper. Please stick with the ebook version, it is completely free and open source anyway, and saves the environment.
