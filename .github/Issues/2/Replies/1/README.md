I am a little bit late to closing this. I didn't think I would finish so quickly. I originally was going to do it all manually on GitHub, but a little bit in, I found a much more efficient way, which was to create a copy, take out all the private and large files, add `IGNORE.md` files, and upload it to GitHub piece by piece. It reduced the time needed by over a week. Some documents may never be able to be added due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte file limit (there were some documents that were over 400 megabytes in size) anyway, I am closing this issue, as the problem has been resolved.
