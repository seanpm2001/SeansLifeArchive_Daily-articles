### Journaling data not yet fully available

This journal project contains a lot of sensitive information, and a lot of documents over 25 megabytes in size (especially in 2017, and 2018) I have a planned full release date of May 15th 2040, if I die before this, I will have my successor release it all early. 

I am still deciding on which documents can be made public. There will be some documents going public eventually, but likely only ones that are older than 4 years.

Right now, I am working on building the structure for the documents, so that the journaling package can be emulated without all data, and later on, with all data.
