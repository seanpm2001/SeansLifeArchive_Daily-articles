## Release date

Prior to 2023, Monday, January 30th, I had planned to release my daily journal on 2040, May 15th. As of 2023, Monday, January 30th to 2023, Wednesday, February 1st, I have been making considerations for releasing the journal 10 years earlier, on 2030, May 15th.

The decision for this came from the fact that I want to share my journaling before my parents die. Some problems need to be addressed first.

## Problems

### Sensitive information and events

Many events that may be sensitive are described in the journal. They include:

- `[REDACTED]`
- `[REDACTED]`
- `[REDACTED]`

### Publishing format

The journal is gigantic, and requires a lot of documents to be published. The journal cannot fit into a single 512 megabyte file, it requires over 20 gigabytes of space (there is media in the journal)

There will be 4 variants to be published:

- Daily
- Monthly
- Yearly
- File System (the original file structure)

I am unsure how to publish. I also don't know if I am going to release it all at once, or 1 day at a time.

### Missing context

The journal requires a lot of context, and the context is included outside of the documents most of the time.

### Other

Unlisted.

## Other

In the end, I might think of this as "wow that was easy and relatively harmless, why didn't I do so earlier?"
